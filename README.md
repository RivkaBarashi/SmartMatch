* Define matching preferences
* Receive dynamic match suggestions
* Send and manage interests
* Approve or reject match requests
* Share profile files after mutual approval
* Escalate approved matches to an administrator

The platform was built with a strong focus on:

* Modular architecture
* Secure authentication
* Scalable backend structure
* Clean UI/UX
* Real-world workflow simulation

# 🧱 System Architecture

The project follows a modular Full Stack architecture:

```text
Client (React)
   ↓
REST API (Express)
   ↓
Business Logic Layer (Services)
   ↓
MongoDB Database
```

## Backend Layers

### Routes

Responsible for defining API endpoints.

### Controllers

Handle incoming requests and responses.

### Services

Contain business logic and database operations.

### Models

Mongoose schemas and database structure.

### Middleware

Authentication and authorization validation.

---

# 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

The system uses JWT authentication.

## Authentication Flow

1. User logs in
2. Server validates credentials
3. JWT token is generated
4. Token is stored in localStorage
5. Protected routes validate token access

## Authorization

The application supports:

* Regular users
* Admin users

Admin-only routes are protected via middleware.

---

# 🤖 AI Integration

Currently, the system does not include AI integrations.

However, the architecture was designed to support future AI-based recommendation systems such as:

* Compatibility scoring
* Smart ranking
* Recommendation optimization

---

# 🗄 Database Structure

## Main Collections

### Users

Stores:

* Credentials
* Roles
* Authentication data

### Profiles

Stores:

* Personal information
* Study place
* Occupation
* Financial capabilities
* Resume and image paths

### Preferences

Stores:

* Matching requirements
* Appearance preferences
* Financial requirements

### Interests

Stores:

* Match requests
* Approval states
* Admin transfer states
